"If" by Rudyard Kipling
If you can keep your head when all about you   
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
